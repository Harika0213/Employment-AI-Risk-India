📊 Indian Employment & AI Risk Analysis (2023–2028)
📌 Project Overview
This project explores the Indian employment landscape, analyzing salary distributions, industry trends, and the perceived impact of AI on the workforce. Starting with a "messy" dataset containing inconsistent entries and missing values, I performed end-to-end Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to derive strategic insights.

🎯 Business Objectives
Salary Benchmarking: Determine the "Metro Premium" and the financial impact of career progression.

AI Readiness: Identify sectors with the highest exposure to AI automation risks.

Stability Analysis: Measure employment-to-unemployment ratios across different demographics and education levels.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Libraries:

Pandas: Data cleaning and transformation.

Seaborn & Matplotlib: Advanced statistical visualization.

Numpy: Numerical operations and data type handling.

Environment: Jupyter Notebook.
🧹 Data Engineering Highlights
To move from raw data to insights, I executed several critical data engineering steps:

String Normalization: Cleaned inconsistent categories (e.g., merging "Tech" and "Fintech" into "Technology").

Feature Engineering:

Created Annual_Salary_LPA: Converting monthly INR to Lakhs Per Annum.

Created Is_Metro: Flagging Tier-1 cities (Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad).

Created Experience_Level: Categorizing professionals into Fresher, Mid, and Senior levels.

Date Transformation: Extracted Month/Year features from varied date formats to facilitate trend analysis.

📈 Visual Storytelling
The analysis is supported by 8 distinct visualization scenarios, ensuring a 360-degree view of the workforce:

Market Share of Salary Tiers: Solid Pie chart showing the split of High, Mid, and Low-income earners.

Industry Pay Gap: Boxplots visualizing salary variance and ceilings within different sectors.

AI Exposure by Sector: Stacked bar charts showing which industries report the highest perceived AI risk.

Career Progression: Average salary benchmarks for each career stage.

Generational Anxiety: A Heatmap correlating Age Groups with AI Risk perceptions.

Salary Density: Violin plots visualizing income concentration across age demographics.

Geographic Stability: Grouped bar charts comparing employment status in Metro vs. Non-Metro locations.

🚀 Key Strategic Insights
The Postgraduate Advantage: Advanced degrees (Masters/PhD) are the primary gateway to the 'High Income' salary tier.

The AI Paradox: High-paying Technology roles report the highest "High AI Risk," suggesting that higher salaries currently correlate with higher automation susceptibility.

The Metro Premium: Living in a Metro city provides not only higher pay but a significantly more stable employment ratio.

Experience Scaling: There is a notable "Salary Jump" at the 10-year experience mark, signaling the shift from execution-based to strategy-based roles.
